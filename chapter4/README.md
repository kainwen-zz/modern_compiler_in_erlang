Notes for Chapter 4 (Abstract Syntax)
=====================================

I do not like some designs of the abstract syntax in the book:

* transform `&` and `|` to `if` expression
* transform unary negation `(-i)` to `0-i`
* `escape` flag
* type fields


I decide to keep my design to see what to do in furture.
